[Beta 12]
	
	- Changed name to "TweenGMX"
	- Progress on new documentation
	- System initilazation stability
	- Delayed tweens now respect group scales
	- Improved VM and YYC Performance
	- Improved performance for tween initialisation
	- Improved performance for tweens with more than 8 properties
	- Optimized Elastic eases
	- Changed function parameter names to avoid naming conflicts
	- Fixed error when using TP*() function as first argument in off-rail tweens
	- Updated JSDoc (WIP)
	
	- YYC: Re-enabled conversion of ease functions into Animation Curves for improved performance
		* Activated when using "ease" strings -- (e.g.) TweenFire(id, "outSine", ...)
		* Directly using Ease functions will force using the function instead -- (e.g.) TweenFire(id, EaseOutSine, ...)
	
	- Ease() now supports "ease" strings
		* e.g. 
			x = Ease(x, mouse_x, 0.5, "ioQuad");
			
	- Removed EaseNone macro
		* Please use empty "" string instead
	
	- System variables no longer reset on game restart or if shared tweener is destroyed/recreated
		* This includes Default Tween values
		* You are now responsible for resetting values with TweenSystemSet(), TweenDefaultSet(), and TweenGroupSetTimeScale()
	
	- Structs can now use TweenEasy*() functions if they have matching variable names
		*e.g. x, y, direction, image_angle, image_alpha, etc...
	
	- Changed default "normalized duration" type to 'weight:'
		* Used when passing duration inside array -- e.g. [duration]
		* Please change to 'cut' if needing to retain old functionality
		
	- Added EaseFastToSlow, EaseMidSlow, and EaseHeartbeat
		* These use the default bezier animation curves (except "heartbeat")
		* You can remove them, if desired
		* They provide an example for creating your own custom ease types for TweenGMX using animation curves
		* They can also be used as strings...
			e.g. "FastToSlow", "fast_to_slow", "fast_slow"
				 "MidSlow", "mid_slow"
				 "Heartbeat", "heartbeat", "heart"
				 
	- Added macro TWEEN_CALLBACK_SELF for accessing the calling callback from within an event
		* This can be used to disable or invalidate a callback within the callback itself
		* e.g.
			// SOME TWEEN EVENT CALLBACK
			if (instance_exists(o_Player)) {
				show_message("EVENT EXECUTED!");
			}
			else {
				TweenCallbackInvalidate(TWEEN_CALLBACK_SELF);
			}
		
	
[Beta 11]

	- Removed "copy on write" array dependency
	- Fixed TweenPlay() not working when overriding values
	- Fixed Support Functions not working with tweens using struct targets - e.g. TweenPause(), TweenResume(), etc...
	- Fixed "Easy Tweens" causing error if called at very start of game
	- TPFuncShared() should no longer cause error if called at launch
	- TPCol() now supports struct targets
	- Improved support for struct targets when using TP*() property functions
	- Cleaned up Tween Select with TGMX_TweensExecute() to better support determining between structs and instances
	- Fixed tweens not supporting more than 10 properties when using function/method ease types
	- TweenCallbackIsEnabled() now returns [false] instead of [undefined] for null tweens
	- Moved TGMX_OPTIMISE_USER macro into Settings script
	
	- Improved performance for properties using dot notation
		* e.g. TweenFire(..., "other.x", 0, 100)
	
	- Improved Performance for property modifiers
		*e.g. TweenFire(..., TPRound("x"), 0, 100);

	- Various TP*() modifiers now support syntax "global.var", "self.var", and "other.var"
		* e.g. TweenFire(o_Baddie, "io", 0, true, 0, 1, TPRound("self.x"), 0, 100);

	(Breaking Changes)

	- Weak references are no longer supported as a valid tween target

	- "Normalized Duration" setup and behaviour has been changed with a new 'rate:' | 'weight:' | 'split:' | 'max:' | 'min:' struct system
		* Note: For tween's with only a single property, there is no difference between the calculation modes.
				It only makes a difference when there are 2 or more properties involved.
			
		* NOTE: passing durations as an array (e.g. [100]) is still valid and will use the 'rate:' calculation
			-- This differs from previous versions which used the 'split:' calculation
			-- Please change existing code to {split:value} if needing to maintain previous timings.
	
		* 'rate:' 
		* sets the duration to the total combined absolute change of properties, divided by the 'rate' value supplied
		* e.g. 
			TweenFire(id, "io", 0, true, 0, {rate:50}, "x", 0, 100, "y", 0, 100); // Will equal 4 seconds when using delta time
	
		* 'weight:' 
		* is similar to 'rate' but is affected by the weighted change of each property
		* NOTE: How weight is calculated could be changed in the future (I am still considering how to best handle this)
		* e.g.
			TweenFire(id, "io", 0, true, 0, {weight:50}, "x", 0, 100, "y", 0, 100); // Will equal 3 seconds when using delta time
	
		* 'split:' 
		* is similar to 'rate' but divides the final calculated duration by the total number of properties included
		* NOTE: Use this option to preserve previous beta functionality
		* e.g.
			TweenFire(id, "io", 0, true, 0, {split:50}, "x", 0, 100, "y", 0, 100); // Will equal 2 seconds when using delta time
	
		* 'max:'
		* finds the property with the greatest absolute change and divides by the given amount -- other properties are not included in the calculation
		* e.g.
			TweenFire(id, "io", 0, true, 0, {max:50}, "x", 0, 100, "y", 0, 20); // Will only include the change in 'x' for calculation
			
		* 'min:'
		* finds the property with the lowest absolute change and divides by the given amount -- other properties are not included in the calculation
		* e.g.
			TweenFire(id, "io", 0, true, 0, {min:50}, "x", 0, 100, "y", 0, 20); // Will only include the change in 'y' for calculation
	
		* The optional 'use:' field can tell a tween to only consider a select number of properties for duration calculation
		* e.g.
			// "image_angle" will NOT be included in duration calculation
			TweenFire(id, "io", 0, true, 0, {rate:250, use:2}, "x>", mouse_x, "y>", mouse_y, "image_angle", 0, 360);
		

	(Experimental)

	- Added TPTrack() function for dynamically tracking destination values
		* This is VERY early and subject to change
		*e.g.
			TweenFire(id, "io", 0, true, 0, 1, TPTrack("x", x, obj_Baddie, "x"),0,1, TPTrack("y", y, obj_Baddie, "y"),0,1);


[10.0] 

	- Fixed undefined/null tween id not being supported by various functions and returning wrong results
		* TweenExists()
		* TweenIsActive()
		* TweenIsPlaying()
		* TweenSet()

	- TweenAddCallback() now supports 'undefined' as a valid callback target for 
	  maintaining a method's original instance/struct calling environment
		* e.g.
			TweenAddCallback(tween_id, "finish", undefined, obj_Player.some_method);
			
		* If the callback is not a method, the tween's existing target will be used as the callback's target

	- Inline callbacks now support 'self', 'other', and 'undefined' as optional callback targets when
	  passed as the first value within an array --> TweenFire(..., "@finish", [self, some_callback])
		* e.g.
			Show = function(str) 
			{ 
				show_message(str); 
			};
			
			// Default -- will use tween's target (obj_John) as callback environment
			TweenFire(obj_John, "io", "once", true, 0, 1, "x>", 10, "@finish", [Show, "A"]);
			
			// Maintain original callback calling environment (undefined)
			TweenFire(obj_John, "io", "once", true, 0, 1, "x>", 10, "@finish", [undefined, Show, "B"]);
			
			// Use current environment as target (self)
			TweenFire(obj_John, "io", "once", true, 0, 1, "x>", 10, "@finish", [self, Show, "C"]);
			
			// Use other environment as target (other)
			TweenFire(obj_John, "io", "once", true, 0, 1, "x>", 10, "@finish", [other, Show, "D"]);
			
			// Explicitly set a callback target by passing a struct with 'target' proprety
			TweenFire(obj_John, "io", "once", true, 0, 1, "x>", 10, "@finish", [{target: obj_Mark}, Show, "E"]);
			
	- TweenScript() and TweenMoreScript() now support 'undefined' as a valid target.
	  "Target arrays" are also now supported for setting a tween target and callback target independently.
	  * e.g.
		// Maintain method's original calling environment for callback (the tween itself will use 'self' as its target)
		TweenScript(undefined, true, 1, obj_Player.some_method);
		
		// Set the tween target and callback target, respectively --> [tween_target, callback_target]
		TweenScript([self, other], true, 1, some_method);
		
		// Set tween target and maintain method's original calling environment.
		TweenScript([obj_Player, undefined], true, 1, some_method);
	

[9.0]

	- Changed TweenGetDefault() and TweenSetDefault() to TweenDefaultGet() and TweenDefaultSet()
		* This is for better naming consistency, as TweenGroupGet() and TweenGroupSet() might also become a thing in the future

	- Changed naming for legacy global "health" and "score" to "health!" and "score!"
		* This allows instances and structs to now use health and score variable names
		* Note that self.health and self.score must be used to access values for instances

	- Methods passed to callbacks are now assigned targets
		* using the keyword [undefined] will have the method use its original instance/struct environment
		* e.g.
			var _cb = function() { x = 100; }
		
			// Set explicit target environment for callback
			TweenAddCallback(tween, "finish", obj_Player, _cb);
		
			// Use methods original calling environment
			TweenAddCallback(tween, "finish", undefined, _cb);
		
	- Added HTML5 Workarounds
		* Added explicit getters for built-in variables

	- Improved system initialization and cleanup
	
	- Normalized setters now support dot notation and to> | <from syntax

	- Fixed and improved property scoping
	
		*** NOTE: Using variable scoping will perform slower ***
	
		* Fixed explicit global scoping  
			e.g. 
				TweenFire(id, "io", 0, 0, 0, 1, "global.some_value", 0, 100);
	
		* Added support for "self" 
			e.g. 
				TweenFire(other, "io", 0, 0, 0, 1, "self.some_value", 0, 100);
	
		* Improved support for when the calling environment is a struct
			e.g.
				// Inside Struct
				TweenFire(self, "io", 0, 0, 0, 1, "other.some_value", 0, 100);
			
		* Fixed To/From not working with "other.value"
			e.g.
				TweenFire(self, "io", 0, 0, 0, 1, "other.some_value>", 100);

		* More general property scoping improvements
			e.g.
				TweenFire(id, "io", 0, 0, 0, 1, "obj_Player.my_struct.value", 0, 100); // Now valid
				TweenFire(id, "io", 0, 0, 0, 1, "struct_a.struct_b.value", 0, 100); // Now valid

		* The fastest version (Curve/Function) will automatically be selected for active target platform when using "ease" strings

	- Setting a delay with TweenSet() now sets internal "delay start" value automatically
		* Use TweenSet("delay_start") to ONLY change delays for newly played tweens

	- Fixed error when using TweenPlay() with ease types passed as an array

[5.2]
	-Updated TweenSet() support
		* TweenSet(t, "start/destination", 123) better supports tweens created with TweenCreate()
		* TweenSet/Get(tween, "property") works again!
		* Added "raw_start" and "raw_destination" support for TweenGet()/TweenSet()
	
	-Extended tween selection to support custom lists and arrays holding tween ids

	-[self] and [other] can now be used as valid targets
		* TweenFire(self, ...)
	
	-Start and Destination strings can now call "global.variable" and "self.variable" explicitly
		* [self] tells to use variable belonging to calling environment when tween fired and not the tween target (though... target and caller are often the same)
		* If no explicit environment is specified, TweenGMS will first check for the existing variable within the target scope, then caller scope, then global scope
		* global.var and self.var currently work but global.var.othervar and global.var.othervar will break -- I hope to expand this in the future


[4.1]

	-Structs can now be used as valid tween targets
		TweenFire(aStruct, EaseLinear, 0, true, 0, 1, "x>", 10);

		TweenFire("$60", "~ioQuad", "x>", 10);			// Optimised
		TweenFire("$60", "~", CurveInOutQuad, "x>", 10);	// Optimised
		TweenFire("$60", "~", EaseInOutQuad, "x>", 10);	// Not Optimised -- still calls ease function directly

		TweenFire(">>", "$60", "abc", 10, 100);

	-Added ability to pass target id for inline tween callbacks by passing a struct as first array element with target value
		TweenFire(..., "@finish", [{target:other}, Explode]);
	
	-Added TWEEN_SELF so tweens can now reference themselves in functions/methods for event callbacks.
		TweenFire("$60", "#patrol", "x>", 100, "@continue", function(){ TweenPause(TWEEN_SELF) });
	
	-TweenMore() now works with 0,-1,-2,... indexing
		TweenFire(...);

====================
= Previous Changes =
====================

	-TweenFire() can now use "ease" and "mode" strings -- e.g. TweenFire(id, "ioQuad", "patrol", true, 0, 1, "x", 0, 100);
	-TweenMore() now works with 0,-1,-2,... indexing.
	-Added TWEEN_SELF so tweens can now reference themselves in functions/methods for event callbacks.
		TweenFire("$60", "#patrol", "x>", 100, "@continue", function(){ TweenPause(TWEEN_SELF) });
	-Fixed issue where TweenEventClear() failed to actually clear the event... derp.
	-Added support for "object.id, x" properties
	-Added TPStruct
	-TweenAddCallback()/TweenAddCallbackUser() now support "event" strings.
		e.g. "finish", "@finish"
	-Added group time scales
	-Optimised EaseElastic* functions
	-Added support for self and other .. Remove need for Tweens() scripts ... TweenPause({group:5});
	-Add support for duration swap array -- done
	-Fixed TweenPlay() to properly reset internal tween direction -- this could cause unexpected behaviour or tweens to fail completely
	-Removed need for Tweens() script --> Added struct { } support. e.g. TweenPause({group: 2}) .. TweenResume({target: oSign, group: 3}) .. TweenPause(self) .. TweenPause(other) .. etc...
	-Added support for "delay" parameter to take array with REST values -- [delayTime, restTime1, restTime2]
	-Added string support for setting easy types -- "InOutQuad", "ioQuad", "iQuad", "oQuad", "io"
	-Strings can now be used to set play modes "once", "bounce", "patrol", "loop", "repeat"
	-Added support for play mode to pass continue count within array [TWEEN_MODE_PATROL, 7]
	-Updated TweenGet
	-Added TweenJust*() scripts
	-Updated TweenStep
	-TGMX_PropertyMethod()
	-TweenCreate/TweenPlay
	-Added support for SET/GET methods
	-Something is broken with "@" again stuff in destination or something
		-- this is because of trailing decimal 	tween = TweenFire("$60", "x:", "@", "@+1.1");
		--> Problem was in TGMX_Variable_Get
	-Changed name of obj_SharedTweener to o_SharedTweener
	-Added "|" for rest and ">" for continue
	-Added continue counts for play modes which continue
	-Callbacks no longer take a target paramter -- As a result, callbacks are no longer auto-cleaned for dead targets -- return undefined from callback script to remove callback
	-Added Ease Switching
	-Added support for animation curves
	-Added support for tweening structures -- e.g. TweenFire("$1", "pos.x>", mouse_x);
	-Added Tween Event for while a tween is resting -- TWEEN_EV_REST
	-Added EaseNone()
	-A negative delay causes targets to immediately jump to initial tween values -- absolute delay value is used for duration
	-Removed support for health and score as they are deprecated
	-Added Getters for mouse_x and mouse_y inorder to support HTML5 (variable_* functions not supporting built-in global variables)
	-[duration] array support -- allows for change-per-step or change-per-second
	-Optimised Ease*Bounce algorithms
	-Improved path performance for HTML5
	-Added time overflow for delayed tweens (should help keep things in sync for games using delta time)
	-Optimised Ease() performance
	-Added "REST" feature for tweens with continue modes
	-Replaced TweenPath() with TPPath (Can be combined with other tween properties)
	-Added TweenEasyPath
	-Clamped tween time between 0 and duration when using TweenGet()
	-Updated TweenCalc (Merged with TweenCalcTime and TweenCalcAmount)
	-Changed TGMX_ExecuteEvent to simply take tween id and event type ... This could allow me to merge the event maps
	-Added /// @params to easing algorithms
	-Added caller id to tween data to make sure right environment is called
	-Fixed YYC warnings
	-Added "#mode" tags
	-Shortened "time_amount" and "time_scale" to "amount" and "scale" -- old tags can still be used
	-Added "shorthand tags" --> TweenCreate(">>", "#2", "+30", "$60", ...);
	-Changed USER EVENT properties to use target environment by default --> no need to use TWEEN_USER_TARGET anymore
		* There is a macro to enable the previous method for faster HTML5 performance
	-Removed TweenCallbackNull() ---> Use undefined instead
	-All tween references are now treated as "safe" -- Removed TweenDestroySafe()
	-Added TweenIsFinished() script
	-Merged "Tweens*()" scripts into one -> Tweens()
	-Removed TweenSystemCount() -> Functionality moved into TweenSystemGet()
	-Removed "round(x)"/"round(y)" -- Use TPRound instead
	-Fixed extended property setters in TGMX_TweenPreprocess
	-Added ability to round/floor/ceil variables --> e.g. TweenFire(..., TPRound("x"), 0, 100);
	-Fixed TPExt not working if property script not "built"
	-Changed TGMX_NULL__ to TGMX_NULL
	-The number 0 can now be used to address last created tween (negative values can access previously created tweens e.g. -1, -2)
	-Changed built-in property script names to prevent naming conflicts
	-Changed TPFuncSharedNormalize to TPFuncSharedNormal
	-Removed TweenForcePropertyUpdate()
	-Removed SharedTweenerDestroy() and SharedTweenerActivate() -- use instance_destroy(o_SharedTweener) and instance_activate_object(o_SharedTweener) instead
	-Fixed values not reaching destination when using TweenMore with same property
	-Delayed state changes made in process loop!
	-Fixed TweenPath() for mode TWEEN_MODE_REPEAT when path not absolute
	-Fixed REPEAT mode
	-Added relative time factor
	-Added to/from support for data structure properties --> e.g. TweenFire(..., TPArray("myArray>", 0), 100);
	-Fixed "image_scale" not supporting property getter when using ">"
	-Added global variable support for start/dest string values
	-TweenFire(">>", 0, "...", ...); // This is similar to using TweenMore
	-Added "tag" support to end of TweenFire(), TweenCreate(), TweenPlay(), and TweenMore()
	-Removed TweenFireTo and TweenFireFrom
	-Improved "_data" array creation speed (TweenFire ... etc)
	-Added "tag" support to TweenFire(), TweenCreate(), TweenPlay(), TweenMore()
	-Added TweenDefaultDelta(bool)
	-Tweens can now be played without supplying properties to tween
	-Added "@event" tags for shorthand callbacks
	-Optimised calls to TPArray(), TPList(), TPGrid()
	-Removed unneeded 'keepPersistent' variable from o_SharedTweener
	-Removed unused variables from o_SharedTweener Room End event

	-TweenStep now honours timescale for delayed tweens
	-Corrected docs for TweenCalcTime() and TweenCalcAmount()
	-Minor tweaks to TweenPath() and ext_path__()
